# odin-recipes
First HTML Project

Initial edit:

This project makes use of the most fundamental HTML tools to create a website that contains recipes of some delicacies with step by step instructions on how to prepare them along with the required ingredients.

The website contains a homepage which links other pages within the website, each containing a different recipe and a picture of the prepared meal.

Final edit:

Finished the project but forgot to make a single git add or git commit cycle during the course of building this project. Poor management on my end. Have to be careful next time.
