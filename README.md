First HTML Project

This project makes use of the most fundamental HTML tools to create a website that contains recipes of some delicacies with step by step instructions on how to prepare them along with the required ingredients.

The website contains a homepage which links other pages within the website, each containing a different recipe and a picture of the prepared meal.
